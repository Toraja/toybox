== ssh

To clone my repository using ssh:

. Setup ssh key
. Setup ssh config to use the ssh key for host `personal.github.com`
. Clone repository using the host in ssh config into somewhere under
`~/workspace/github.com/Toraja/`
** The domain in repository URL must be prepended with `personal.` to match the
host in ssh config
** The clone destination must be under `~/workspace/github.com/Toraja/` so that
git automatically modify URL to match the one in ssh config
