# --- Use like bash ---
## `bass` fish plugin is required for this.

# Export variables that a command emits
## e.g. <command> emits A=apple and you want to set it as environment variable for shell.
bass export (<command>)

# Here Document
## It is not (and probably will never be) supported in fish.
## Use `echo` instead.
## e.g.
## cat <<EOF | sed 's/foo/bar/g' > output.txt
## foobar
## barfoo
## EOF
echo "
foobar
barfoo
" | sed 's/foo/bar/g' > output.txt
